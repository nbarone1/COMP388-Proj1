# COMP388-Proj1
CNN Project 1 for COMP 388 at LUC Spring of 2022: Nicholas Barone and Emyrs Kaya
Project using Convultion Neural Networks to identify integers from 0-9 and multiplication addition and subtraction symbols to
evaluate simple computational equations based on a visual input

So if the input is an image of 3+5 the CNN should identify 3,+,5 perform the operation and output the answer, 8.
